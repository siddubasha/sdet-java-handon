	  Collections , Lambda expression , Streams are introduced from Java 8 to get
	  functional programming feature in java.
	  
	  Collection: It is used to represent a group of objects in a single entity
	  
	  Streams: These are used to process the elements of collection.
	  
	  Streams providing two  mechanisms to process the elements of Collection
	  
	  1. Filter
	  2. Map
	  
	  Note: Java.io.* ( provides streams to deal with files in java)
	        Java.util.streams( provides streams to process the elements of collection)
	        
	      Filter: Based on condtions it will filter the list and make them as seperate collection or use them for some other porpous.
	      Map: take evry element in collection do operation on it , then store result in seperate collection or use them for some other porpous.
	      
	     Architecture:  Collection(Source)---->Streams(now perform operations like filter or map on stream)-----> Collection(Destination)
	     
	     After filtering or maping of data, we can perform  sorted(),count(),collect(),distinct(), foreach(),min(),max() operations on data.
